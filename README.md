# React Router Dom (V6) Navigation, URL Parameters Handling, and Modal Rendering

In this project, React Router Dom (V6) takes center stage for its ability to efficiently manage routing within React applications. By adopting React Router Dom, developers gain access to a powerful and flexible toolset for seamlessly navigating between different views, significantly enhancing the overall user experience.

## Technologies Used:
1. React
2. React Router Dom (V6)
3. React Hooks
4. React Portals

## Navigation Handling:

**React Router Dom** provides a robust solution for handling navigation transitions between various views within the application. Its efficient routing mechanism ensures swift page transitions, minimizing loading times and enhancing user engagement.

A notable advantage of **React Router Dom** is its capability to intercept server calls during navigation. By intercepting these calls, the application can optimize data fetching and rendering processes, resulting in faster load times and improved performance overall.

### Accessing URL Parameters using Hooks:

Utilizing **React Hooks**, the project effortlessly retrieves and manipulates URL parameters. This feature empowers developers to dynamically interact with URL parameters, facilitating personalized and dynamic content rendering based on URL inputs.

* To test this, navigate to the Contact page via the NavBar and click on one of the contact cards, it will show you a custom card based on the URLs ending tag. You can change it in the URL to see the card dynamically pulling the info rathrer than it being hard coded. 

### Modals with React Portals:

**React Portals** are leveraged to create and manage modal components within the application. By utilizing React Portals, modals maintain a consistent user interface while being dynamically rendered outside the DOM hierarchy, ensuring optimal performance and flexibility.

## How to Use
### Installation:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm install or yarn install.

### Running the Application:

Once dependencies are installed, start the development server using ** npm start ** or **yarn start**.
The application will be accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Navigation:

Explore the different views by clicking on the navigation links provided within the application.
Experience seamless transitions between views facilitated by React Router Dom.

### URL Parameter Handling:

Observe how URL parameters influence the content rendered within the application.
Experiment with different URL parameters to dynamically manipulate the displayed content.

### Modal Usage:

Trigger modal components within the application to view additional information or perform specific actions.
Experience the smooth and responsive behavior of modals rendered using React Portals.
